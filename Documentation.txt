Database Name = review_system

Run Migration -> php artisan migrate
then run seeder -> php artisan db:seed

then php artisan serve;
next create user and seller.

User: can see products and reviews and gives review also.
seller: can create Products, see review and also see suspicious review.

then for checking you can run php artisan schedule:run command basically I am creating a Cron Job
but you can call from different handle because I am using in Singleton design pattern.

Review Criteria:
-- morethan 2 review at a time it will consider suspicious
-- user has suspecious before then it will consider suspecious
-- if user sentiment rate below the 1 so it will consider suspecious because consider as full positive
-- check previous review if current review and previous review time gap lessthan 2 hours with the same user so it will consider suspecious
-- check only those type of reviews which has active status, review user has active, seller has active status and time is greaterthan 2 hours from current time
